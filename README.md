# YOLOv5-Based-Deep-Learning-Framework-for-GPR-Hyperbola-Recognition-and-Analysis
This project uses YOLOv5 to detect hyperbolas in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) images, enabling automated identification of buried objects. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization for efficient subsurface analysis.
