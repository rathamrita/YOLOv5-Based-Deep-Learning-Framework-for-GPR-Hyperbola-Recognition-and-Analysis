# YOLOv5-Based-Deep-Learning-Framework-for-GPR-Hyperbola-Recognition-and-Analysis
This project uses YOLOv5 to detect hyperbolas in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) images, enabling automated identification of buried objects. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization for efficient subsurface analysis.
## 1. Dataset Description
Used 250 stimulated Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) images.

The dataset contains synthetic hyperbolic patterns caused by subsurface objects.

The dataset is not publicly disclosed at this stage.
